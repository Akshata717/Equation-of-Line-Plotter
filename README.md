# Equation-of-Line-Plotter

## Description
A Python program with a Tkinter GUI that lets you input two points "(x1, y1) and (x2, y2)" to plot the straight line connecting them.  
It automatically calculates and displays the equation of the line, and vertical lines are handled correctly.

## Features
- User-friendly Tkinter GUI for entering points  
- Calculates slope "m" and intercept "b" for the line "y = mx + b"
- Handles vertical lines automatically  
- Plots the line using Matplotlib  
- Displays the equation of the line in the GUI  

## Example
Input: 
x1 = 1, y1 = 2
x2 = 4, y2 = 8

Output: 
Graph of y = 2x + 0
